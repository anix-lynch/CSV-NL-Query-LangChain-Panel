## 🚀 Query CSV Files with Natural Language Using LangChain and Panel

Welcome to this exciting project where you can interact with tabular datasets in a whole new way! We're using natural language queries to analyze CSV files, all powered by LangChain, OpenAI, and displayed beautifully using HoloViz Panel and Plotly. Let's dive in! 😎

## Project Overview

This project brings together the power of large language models (LLMs) and a user-friendly web interface. With this application, you can upload your CSV files and analyze them using natural language—no coding required! 🧑‍💻

### Key Features:

- 📁 **File Upload**: Upload any CSV file and get started.
- 💬 **Natural Language Chat Box**: Ask questions about the dataset using natural language, powered by LangChain and OpenAI.
- 📊 **Interactive Table**: See your CSV data instantly in a table format.
- 📉 **Custom Plotly Scatter Plot**: Visualize relationships between features using a dynamic scatter plot.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: For creating DataFrame agents that use LLMs to analyze and interpret your data.
- **Panel**: A simple web framework to create interactive dashboards.
- **Plotly**: For rich, interactive scatter plot visualizations.
- **OpenAI**: The engine behind the natural language processing.

## 🤖 Examples of What You Can Do

- **Upload your data**: Simply drag and drop your CSV file into the app.
- **Ask questions**: Use the chat box to ask questions like:
  - "What is the total revenue for each product?"
  - "How many rows have missing values?"
- **Visualize**: Plot custom scatter plots to discover trends and patterns.
